This repository contains source code for running the core analysis described in the paper. Sequences, protein abundance data, recombination rates, etc. should be downloaded from their respective repositories as outlined in our methods. Scripts may be found within folders which correspond to each part of the methods section of the paper.

If you wish to completely replicate any of our results, please send me an e-mail and we can sort something out (a.t.ho@bath.ac.uk).
